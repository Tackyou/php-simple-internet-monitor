# php-simple-internet-monitor
Just a script to log internet outages

I made this to prove to my ISP that the connection is unreliable, it lost connection every few minutes

You run it in console with `php connection.tester.php`, it will write a "internet.log" file in the same folder as the script, as soon as the first outage has been detected.
